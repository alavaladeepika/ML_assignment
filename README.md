Q1) Given the Housing dataset, compute and compare the param-
eters learnt from various models - Linear Regression(closed form, Gradient
Descent, Newton’s Method), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression.

Q2) Given the Iris Dataset, perform Binary Classification, using
the models - Nearest Neighbour, Naive-Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regres-
sion(Gradient Descent, Newton’s method, using Library)

Q3) Given D51 Dataset, perform Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
and then Binary Classification using the models - Nearest Neighbour, Naive-
Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression(Gradient Descent, Newton’s method,
using Library)
